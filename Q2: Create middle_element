Create a function called middle_element that has one parameter named lst. 

 

If there are an odd number of elements in lst, the function should return the middle element. If there are an even number of elements, the function should return the average of the middle two elements.

 

Hint:

 

Remember to use modulus % to determine if a number is divisible by 2. 

 

Check if your function is working properly or not pasting below line in your code at the end:

 

print(middle_element([5, 2, -10, -4, 4, 5])) #This should print -7.0
